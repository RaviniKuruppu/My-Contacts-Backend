# Simple Node.js Express Backend Project ðŸš€

This is a simple backend project built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. This project provides a straightforward example of a backend application, demonstrating the use of popular technologies to handle HTTP requests, interact with a MySQL database, and serve as a foundation for more complex applications.

# Technologies Used

**Node.js**: The project is built on the Node.js runtime, providing a server-side JavaScript environment.

**Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build robust and scalable APIs.

**MySQL**: The MySQL database is employed to store and retrieve data for the application.

# Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to enhance organization and maintainability:

**controllers/**: Manages HTTP request handling and response logic.

**middleware/**: Holds middleware components for request processing.

**routes/**: Defines API routes and their respective controller actions.

**database/**: Involves modules related to database interactions.
